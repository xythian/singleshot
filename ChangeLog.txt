Version 2.0.0a1, ...
  - Substantially rearranged dispatch.   All CGI entry now goes
  through sscgi.py which centralizes some error reporting and
  dispatches to action_* handlers.
  - Defined a 'virtual' handler for files and directories that do not
  exist, permitting the action_tag handler to be invoked for /tag/blah
  - Replaced Cheetah with SimpleTAL for templates
  - Added support to JpegHeader for reading XMP data from JPEGs
  - Started to remove support for using raw JPEG comments as captions
  - Defined mechanism for filtered images and added filters/ directory
  to contain those filters.
  - Added PIL-based resizer
  - Moved image processing from albums.py to imageprocessor.py
  - Moved tag-related code from albums.py to action_tag.py
  - Added test script extractor.py for running experiments locally
  - Removed traceback eating behavior of virtual_demand_property
  - Started to define prettier template for default singleshot templates.K
  - Completely rewrote EXIF and IPTC reading.
  - Virtualized access to the CGI data to enable more deployment
  options. 
  - Added experimental mod_python and FastCGI interfaces to allow
  Singleshot to be run as a persistent process (== fast).

Version 1.0.1, 29 March 2004
  - Bug fix #905628: Setting highlight image in _album.cfg doesn't work

    turn uses fork/exec
